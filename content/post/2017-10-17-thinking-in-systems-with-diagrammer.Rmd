I recently read Thinking in Systems yada yada
  
First we need to install `DiagrammeR`. 
```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("DiagrammeR")
```

I actually had a minor snafu trying to install this on my Mac. Trying to compile a dependency package `tidyr` required opening up Xcode and accepting the user agreement. But after that we were all set.

```{r}
library(DiagrammeR)
```

```{r}
grViz("
 
digraph boxes_and_cirles {

  # add shapes
  node [shape = box]
  Water
  Air

}      
")
```
