<hr>
I’m proud to announce that I have published my first R package, <code>rhymer</code>!<br />
Version 1.0 is now available on <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rhymer">CRAN</a>. You can view the source code on <a href="http://github.com/landesbergn/rhymer">github</a>, and see the website for the package <a href="https://landesbergn.github.io/rhymer/">here</a>.
<hr>
<p>The goal of <code>rhymer</code> is to provide an R interface to the <a href="https://www.datamuse.com/api">Datamuse API</a> in order to find rhyming words. The core function of <code>rhymer</code> is <code>get_rhyme()</code>, which can be used in a variety of ways.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(rhymer)

# get rhymes for &quot;R&quot; and return a 5 word vector
get_rhyme(&quot;R&quot;, return_type = &quot;vector&quot;, limit = 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;bar&quot;    &quot;car&quot;    &quot;star&quot;   &quot;avatar&quot; &quot;far&quot;</code></pre>
<p>For example, I’ve been enjoying rewriting nursery rhymes:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glue::glue(&quot;
  Jack and Jill 
  Went up the {get_rhyme(&#39;Jill&#39;, return_type = &#39;rand&#39;)} 
  To fetch a pail of water. 
  Jack fell down 
  And split his {get_rhyme(&#39;down&#39;, &#39;rand&#39;)},
  And Jill came tumbling {get_rhyme(&#39;water&#39;, &#39;rand&#39;)}&quot;
)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Jack and Jill 
## Went up the bill 
## To fetch a pail of water. 
## Jack fell down 
## And split his gown,
## And Jill came tumbling manslaughter</code></pre>
<p>The package includes additional functions to find other related words, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>get_means_like()</code> to find words of similar meaning<br />
</li>
<li><code>get_sounds_like()</code> to find words that sound similar</li>
<li><code>get_spelled_like()</code> to find words that are spelled similarly</li>
</ul>
<p>There are some more examples on the <a href="https://landesbergn.github.io/rhymer/">rhymer website</a> as well as in the package vignette <a href="https://landesbergn.github.io/rhymer/articles/intro-to-rhymer.html">“Intro to rhymer”</a>.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to seeing what you come up with as an interesting use case for <code>rhymer</code>! Please submit all issues or feature requests on <a href="https://github.com/landesbergn/rhymer/issues">github</a>.</p>
