I used to have a website on Squarespace. It was nice, but it cost ~$90 a year, and I wasn't really using it for much. So... enter `blogdown`!

`blogdown` is an R package that allows you to make websites using a bunch of technologies in concert. This site uses `R` and `Markdown` and `R Markdown` and `Hugo` and `Netlify` and `Git` and `Github` and on and on. If this seems overwhelming, don't worry, there are plenty of resources out there to help. 

When building this site, the two resources I consulted were:

* [This wonderful guide](https://apreshill.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/) from Alison Presmanes Hill
* [The `blogdown` documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) from Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, and Alison Presmanes Hill

It might seem complicated, but with some coffee and tenacity whole thing can be done in an afternoon!
