Product Manager in the Boston area, focused on leveraging data to build great products. On the side I like to tinker in building software that is mostly useless, like an [R package for finding rhyming words](https://landesbergn.github.io/rhymer/index.html), or an iOS weather app that tells you what the weather ["feels like"](https://github.com/landesbergn/feels-like).
