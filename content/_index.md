Bay Area-based product manager who likes using data to build great products. In my spare time I build software that's mostly useless, like an [R package for finding rhyming words](https://landesbergn.github.io/rhymer/index.html) or an iOS weather app that tells you what it "[feels like](https://github.com/landesbergn/feels-like)" outside.
